# Normalize EOL for all files that Git considers text files

* text=auto eol=lf
* cmd=auto eol=crlf

# Except for Windows-only / Visual Studio files

*.bat eol=crlf

# The above only works properly for Git 2.10+, so for older versions
# we need to manually list the binary files we don't want modified.
